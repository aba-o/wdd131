				Welcome to The Duala Foundation
				Communities thrive when individuals believe in their potential and use their knowledge to solve local
				problems. This website exists to inspire, educate, and empower people, especially youth, in small
				communities to make a difference using what they already have.
				Named after Kwame Adjoku Otchere (Duala), The Duala Foundation has been organized to continue Kwame's vision for a better world. 
				Kwame was one of those rare humans who threw themselves into projects with careless abandon, with an essential 
				kindness that benefitted both the people he cared about and those he barely knew. Kwame loved people - friends and strangers alike -
				and his unspoken aim was to help anyone anywhere anytime out of the goodness of his big heart!
				<br> 
				Eduma School Building Project The Eduma School Building project by Duala Foundation is a powerful example of how community collaboration can change lives. It began in response to a tragic event—a child lost their life to a snakebite during the long walk to school in a neighboring town. Eduma, a small town near 
				Yamoransa in the Central Region of Ghana, had no school of its own. Children were learning in unfinished buildings and unsafe conditions. To solve this, the Duala Foundation raised 40,000 cedis to start building a safe, two-storey school for the community. Later, the Helping Africa Foundation joined as a partner, completing major phases of the construction. 
				Thanks to these efforts and the generous support of groups like the University of Cape Coast 70s year group, 150 children now have a secure and proper place to learn. But this is just the beginning. The project also aims to host evening vocational classes for women in the community, reflecting our holistic approach to empowerment and development. 
				The Chosen Sister Fund Launched in October 2021, the Chosen Sister Fund is an initiative that provides interest-free loans to women across Ghana. These loans are meant to help women start or grow their businesses, improve their family’s livelihood, and give back to their communities.So far, the fund has supported 26 women in the Greater Accra, Central, and Volta Regions with a total of 40,000 cedis. 
				The model is simple but powerful—recipients receive the loan and, once able, contribute a small amount back into the fund to help another woman. It’s a cycle of growth, responsibility, and shared success.
				<br>
				Our Mission To upscale members of small communities by channeling their passion and applying knowledge to solve problems around them with available resources, and thereby improve their livelihoods. 
				We also aim to mentor youth to redirect their education, skills, ideas, and enthusiasm back into their communities to enhance productivity and self-reliance. Our Vision We envision a future where communities are 
				uplifted and self-belief is restored. Our goal is to spark a mindset shift—one that is solution-oriented, empowering, and grounded in possibility. Through inspiration, practical knowledge, and meaningful action, we help individuals combine potential with 
				advanced skills to teach, reach, and achieve more. Who We Are The Duala Foundation is built on love for people and belief in the power of local action. We serve as a bridge between passion and opportunity, helping ordinary people do extraordinary things in their own communities. Our strength lies in collaboration—with donors, partners, volunteers, and, most importantly, the people we serve.
